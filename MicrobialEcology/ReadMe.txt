This folder contains all scripts that were used in the 
"Descriptive Community Level Analyses of Anthropogenically Afflicted Jamaica Bay, NY Using Metagenomic Profiles" publication. 

Within this project, python-based pipelines of QIIME2 and PICRUSt2 were used for taxonomic and functional analysis 
of the 16S rRNA biomarker. Data visualization and statistical analysis was done using the ggplot2 package in R. 

I am more than happy to pass on the report, just send an email to fortinopineda@gmail.com with the title
"Jamaica Bay Report Request". You will be able to see my writing style and thought process.

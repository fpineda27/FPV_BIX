The folders `Microbial_ecology` and `TNBC_Cancer_Prediction` contains the projects for which I completed during my masters. utilizing python and R packages.  

Each folder contains a ReadMe which speaks briefly on the project but I have the final work saved elsewhere for anyone interested. 

The rest of this repository is the basis of my portofolio in bioninformatics and my knowledge center which I hope to grow exorbitantly during the rest of my career.

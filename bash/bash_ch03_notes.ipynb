    "- Filters provide powerful means of combining the input and output of a seqeuence of commands to get the kind of report that you want \n",
    "\n",
    "-  `head` prints first n lines of a file or stdin\n",
    "-  `tail` prints last n lines of a file or stdin\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "ls -l | head -5 # first 5 lines of ls -l\n",

    "`wc` prints line, word, and char counts... `wc -l` prints # of lines\n",

    "- is a stream editor which is not interative & works great as a filter \n",
    "- ideal for batch editing scripts since it usually applies its editing to all lines in the input \n",
    "- by default, it does _not_ edit a file \n",
    "- `i` option allows sed to change a file instead of echoing the modified file to stdout \n",

    "- `s/old/new/g` makes the replacements global \n",
    "- `sed -f sedscript -n sed4` # -n makes bash only echo lines we tell it to. This command runs sedscript on sed4  \n",
    "- `date | sed \"s/J/j\"` # replaces J to j\n",
    "- `sed \"1,5p\"` # prints first 5 lines and all lines unless \"-n\" was invoked\n",

    "Examples:\n",
    "- `sed \"/alpha/s/beta/gamma\"`... if lines has alpha on it, sub beta for gamma\n",
